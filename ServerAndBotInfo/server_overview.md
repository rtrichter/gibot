## Reaction Roles
Gibot is in charge of reaction roles to allow more options for us as developers and administrators.  
Information about specific reaction roles will be included in their messages.  

## Color Roles
React using the appropriate color to receive your color role.  
The rainbow role will change colors (randomly) every hour which is kinda fun

## Floor Roles
React to the message with your floor to get your role.  
You can only have one of these roles at a time.  
Do not spam these roles, they are rate limited.  

Admin teams are assigned to each floor and will have freedom to do as they please (within the rules) in their respective spaces.  

Every floor will have its own space (managed by floor admins) to talk and do things.  
Although every floor already has a discord server, this one is not affiliated with RIT and is run by your fellow floor mates.  

## Sharing Information With Other Members
Each member has the option to save and share their information.  
(such as real/preferred name, phone number, socials, room number, whether or not you can dm them, their preferred contact method, and more)  

Every member has the option to not store any information and will not have any penalty if they choose to do so.  
In the future, the bot may be able to access this information. Members may choose who is able to access their information.  

By default no one can access personal information unless it is allowed by the user.  
Editing personal information does NOT implicitly grant access for any party (bot, member, or admin) to access information

### Interests
Roles are used to identify other Gibson members with similar interests.  
It will also unlock channels to talk to other members of your floor.  

### Pronouns and Gender
Commands are used to set your preferred gender and pronouns.  
You can also set this information in your discord profile but we are aware that you may not want that information to be seen in other servers.  

If your pronouns or gender are not common don't worry!
Just tell Gibot your pronouns or gender and you will get a new role for your pronouns or gender.  
Gibot will accommodate any gender/pronouns you enter (don't abuse this... ([rules](rules)))
