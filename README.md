### Colors:
The server contains several standard colors that can be assigned via a reaction role system  
The colors we will use are:
- red

**The Rainbow Role:**  
Rainbow Role relies on Gibot.  
Rainbow Role uses a role just like the other color roles
Every hour, Gibot will run a command that assigns a random color to the rainbow role. 

### Floor
Members can assign a number that represents their floor number
This is limited to one of the roles at a time

### Interests
Members can choose certain interests that they like to partake in  
This is a high level branch system:
1. The first layer separates interests like "music", "art", "video games", "athletics", etc
2. The second layer will further divide these interests.  
For example athletics can be split into
