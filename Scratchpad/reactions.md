# Reactions


## What is the goal of reactions?
Allow for simple creation of reaction commands.  

## What are the types of reaction commands.  
First lets define a few things:  
- There are different execution schemes (what happens when the user interacts)
- There are different usage types (How the user interacts)

The command used will be named after the execution scheme.  
For example you will use one command to make a reaction_role and another to make a poll.  

## Execution Schemes
- Polls (There will be further subdivisions of polls too)
  - Options:
    - message_id
    - reaction
    - \# of chances
    - is_blind
  - One chance voting (allow a user to see what their response was)
  - Most recent voting
  - Blind voting (for either option)
- Reaction Roles
- 




# ok i'm gonna slow down a little...
I will go back and elaborate on the previous definitions but for now let's focus on reaction roles.  
I need to make sure that I can do one thing before I make a plan for everything (find out what works, what doesn't, how it works, etc. )
